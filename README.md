#SimpleVoteListener

Originally coded for a server I helped work on it's meant to just be a scaled-back simpler vote listener than most out there currently without all the added extras which are cool but most of the time aren't needed.

to run it you will need Votifier or NuVotifier and placeholderapi for the plugin to run.

If anyone wants any added features ill try to get around to adding them just send me a message, thanks.
